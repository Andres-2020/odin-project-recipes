    <p>Cajun cuisine is sometimes referred to as a 'rustic cuisine', meaning that it is based on locally available ingredients and that preparation is relatively simple.</p>
    <p>An authentic Cajun meal is usually a three-pot affair, with one pot dedicated to the main dish, one dedicated to steamed rice, specially made sausages, or some seafood dish, and the third containing whatever vegetable is plentiful or available. Crawfish, shrimp, and andouille sausage are staple meats used in a variety of dishes. In this case we'll be using shrimp.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine paprika, thyme, oregano, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper in a sealable plastic bag; shake to mix. Add shrimp and shake to coat.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium high heat. Cook and stir shrimp in hot oil until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy</li>
    </ol>
