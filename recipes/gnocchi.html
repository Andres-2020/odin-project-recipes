    <p>Gnocchi are a varied family of dumpling in Italian cuisine. They are made of small lumps of dough composed of semolina, ordinary wheat flour egg, cheese, potato, breadcrumbs, cornmeal or similar ingredients including herbs and vegetables.</p>
    <p>The dough for gnocchi is most often rolled out before it is cut into small pieces about the size of a wine cork. The gnocchi may be pressed with a fork or a cheese grater to make ridges or cut into little lumps. They are usually eaten as a first course, but they can also be served as a side dish to some main courses.</p>
